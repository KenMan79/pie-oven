# Oven

Put your ETH in the oven to bake a pie.


## Pie cycle

A controller address is used to lead the process.

PREPARE
- pool your eth

BAKE
- No more pooling
- The controller is swapping the ETH for PIE (token).

MUNCH
- Baking is done!
- Claim your pie and start eating.

--> PREPARE starts again.
